## loop_mbox and nbio_mbox

- `loop_mbox` = loop + any wakeup (semaphore, custom, or anything)
- `nbio_mbox` = loop + nbio wakeup (a special case of `loop_mbox`)

`nbio_mbox.init_nbio_mbox` creates a `loop_mbox.Mbox` with an nbio-specific `WakeUper`.
All `loop_mbox` procs work on the returned pointer: `send`, `try_receive_batch`, `close`, `destroy`.

## Idiom details

### Idiom 1: Maybe as container — `maybe-container`

**Problem**: You have a `^T` from `new` or `pool.get`. You want to pass it to `send` or `push` safely.

**Fix**: Wrap it in `Maybe(^T)` before any ownership-transferring call.

```odin
// [itc: maybe-container]
m: Maybe(^Itm) = new(Itm)
mbox.send(&mb, &m)
// m is nil here — the mailbox owns the pointer
```

**Why**: The `send`/`push`/`put` APIs take `^Maybe(^T)`. On success, they set the inner pointer to nil. This prevents use-after-send. On failure (closed), inner is left unchanged — the caller still owns it.

---

### Idiom 2: defer with pool.put — `defer-put`

**Problem**: You get an item from the pool and must return it in all paths, including error paths.

**Fix**: Use `defer pool.put` immediately after acquisition.

```odin
itm, status := pool.get(&p)
m: Maybe(^Itm) = itm
defer { // [itc: defer-put]
    ptr, accepted := pool.put(&p, &m)
    if !accepted && ptr != nil { disposable_dispose(&ptr) }
}
// ...
mbox.send(&mb, &m)
```

**Behavior**:
- If send succeeded: `m` becomes nil → `pool.put` becomes a no-op.
- If send failed: `m` still holds pointer → returned to pool by defer.

---

### Idiom 3: dispose signature contract — `dispose-contract`

**Problem**: A struct contains internal heap resources. You need a proc to free them all safely.

**Fix**: Write a dispose proc that follows the `^Maybe(^T)` contract.

```odin
// [itc: dispose-contract]
disposable_dispose :: proc(itm: ^Maybe(^DisposableItm)) {
    if itm^ == nil {return}
    ptr := (itm^).?
    if ptr.name != "" { delete(ptr.name, ptr.allocator) }
    free(ptr, ptr.allocator)
    itm^ = nil
}
```

**Contract**:
- Takes `^Maybe(^T)`. Nil inner is a no-op. Sets inner to nil on return.
- Frees all internal resources before freeing the struct itself.
- Must be safe to call after a partial init. All cleanup steps handle zero-initialized fields.
- Register as `T_Hooks.dispose` so the pool calls it on permanent item destruction.

---

### Idiom 4: defer with dispose — `defer-dispose`

**Problem**: You fill an item with internal heap resources before sending. If send fails, you need to clean up.

**Fix**: Register `dispose` via `defer` right after wrapping in Maybe.

```odin
m: Maybe(^DisposableItm) = itm
defer disposable_dispose(&m)  // [itc: defer-dispose]

m.?.name = strings.clone("hello", m.?.allocator)
if mbox.send(&mb, &m) { result = true }
```

**Behavior**:
- Send success → `m` nil → `dispose` no-op.
- Send fail → `m` non-nil → `dispose` frees everything.

---

### Idiom 5: DisposableItm full lifecycle — `disposable-itm`

**Problem**: Items with internal heap resources need careful handling through pool + mailbox.

**Fix**: Use `pool.get`, fill, `send`, `receive`, `pool.put` with reset, and a separate `dispose` for permanent cleanup. Register all three in `T_Hooks` so the pool manages the lifecycle.

```odin
// Setup: register hooks in pool.init
pool.init(&p, initial_msgs = 4, max_msgs = 0,
    hooks = DISPOSABLE_ITM_HOOKS)

// Producer:
itm, _ := pool.get(&p)
itm.name = strings.clone("hello", itm.allocator)
m: Maybe(^DisposableItm) = itm
defer disposable_dispose(&m)          // [itc: disposable-itm]
mbox.send(&mb, &m)

// Consumer:
got, _ := mbox.wait_receive(&mb)
m2: Maybe(^DisposableItm) = got
pool.put(&p, &m2)                     // [itc: reset-vs-dispose]
```

**Note**: `reset` clears state for reuse. `dispose` frees internal resources permanently. `factory` allocates and initializes. All three are optional in `T_Hooks`.

---

### Idiom 6: foreign item with resources — `foreign-dispose`

**Problem**: `pool.put` returns a pointer when the item is foreign (allocator mismatch). `free` alone leaks resources.

**Fix**: Call `dispose` on the returned pointer, not `free`.

```odin
ptr, recycled := pool.put(&p, &m)
if !recycled && ptr != nil {
    foreign_opt: Maybe(^DisposableItm) = ptr
    disposable_dispose(&foreign_opt)  // [itc: foreign-dispose]
}
```

**Rule**: If allocator does not match pool → pool cannot recycle → caller disposes.

---

### Idiom 7: reset vs dispose — `reset-vs-dispose`

**Problem**: It is easy to confuse `reset` (for reuse) with `dispose` (for permanent cleanup).

**Fix**: Keep them separate. Never free internal resources in `reset`. Register all three hooks in `T_Hooks`.

| Hook | When called | What it does |
|------|-------------|--------------|
| `factory` | Fresh allocation | Allocates struct, sets allocator, inits internal resources |
| `reset` | Get (recycled) and Put (before free-list) | Clears stale state for reuse. Never frees internal resources |
| `dispose` | Permanent destruction (destroy, put-when-full) | Frees internal resources, frees struct, sets itm^ = nil |

```odin
// factory: alloc + init internal resources.
disposable_factory :: proc(allocator: mem.Allocator) -> (^DisposableItm, bool) {
    itm := new(DisposableItm, allocator)
    if itm == nil { return nil, false }
    itm.allocator = allocator
    return itm, true
}

// reset: clears state for reuse.
// [itc: reset-vs-dispose]
disposable_reset :: proc(itm: ^DisposableItm, _: pool.Pool_Event) {
    itm.name = ""
}

// dispose: frees everything permanently.
// [itc: dispose-contract]
disposable_dispose :: proc(itm: ^Maybe(^DisposableItm)) { ... }
```

---

### Idiom 8: dispose is advice — `dispose-optional`

**Problem**: The pool and mailbox do not call `dispose`. Only the caller does. It is easy to forget.

**Fix**: Use `defer` (Idiom 4) or manual drain loops to call `dispose` when an item leaves the system permanently.

```odin
// [itc: dispose-optional]
// You call dispose when the item will not be recycled.
```

---

### Idiom 9: ITC participants in a heap-allocated struct — `heap-master`

**Problem**: Threads must not reference stack memory of a proc that might exit.

**Fix**: `new(Master)` — heap-allocate the owner. Call `dispose` after joining all threads.

```odin
m := new(Master) // [itc: heap-master]
if !master_init(m) { free(m); return false }
// ... spawn threads passing m ...
// ... join threads ...
m_opt: Maybe(^Master) = m
master_dispose(&m_opt)
```

---

### Idiom 10: thread is just a container for its master — `thread-container`

**Problem**: Pointers to thread-local stack participants escape the thread's frame.

**Fix**: Move all ITC participants into the master struct. Thread proc only casts `rawptr` to `^Master`.

```odin
proc(data: rawptr) {
    c := (^Master)(data) // [itc: thread-container]
    // thread owns nothing; ITC objects live in Master
}
```

---

### Idiom 11: errdefer-dispose — `errdefer-dispose`

**Problem**: A factory proc creates a master. If setup fails halfway, partially-init state must be cleaned up.

**Fix**: Use a named return `ok` and `defer if !ok { dispose(...) }`.

```odin
// [itc: errdefer-dispose]
create_master :: proc() -> (m: ^Master, ok: bool) {
    raw := new(Master)
    if !master_init(raw) { free(raw); return }
    m_opt: Maybe(^Master) = raw
    defer if !ok { master_dispose(&m_opt) }

    // ... more setup ...
    m = raw
    ok = true; return
}
```

---

### Idiom 12: destroy resources at scope exit — `defer-destroy`

**Problem**: Pools, mailboxes, or loops must be shut down in all paths to prevent leaks or deadlocks.

**Fix**: Register `destroy` with `defer` immediately after successful initialization.

```odin
mbox.init(&mb)
defer mbox.destroy(&mb) // [itc: defer-destroy]

pool.init(&p)
defer pool.destroy(&p)
```

**Why**: Ensures cleanup in early returns and keeps shutdown logic localized.

### Idiom 13: T_Hooks pattern — `t-hooks`

**Problem**: An item type has internal heap resources. The pool must allocate, reset, and free them correctly. Scattering this logic across call sites leads to leaks.

**Fix**: Define factory/reset/dispose as a `::` compile-time constant next to the item type. Pass it by value to `pool.init`. The pool calls the right hook at each lifecycle point.

```odin
// Define once, next to the type — in itm.odin:
MY_ITM_HOOKS :: pool.T_Hooks(MyItm){
    factory = my_factory, // fresh alloc — nil = new(T, allocator)
    reset   = my_reset,   // reuse hygiene — nil = no-op
    dispose = my_dispose, // permanent free — nil = free(itm, allocator)
}

// Simple type — zero value, all defaults:
pool.init(&p, hooks = pool.T_Hooks(MyItm){})

// [itc: t-hooks]
// Complex type — pass the constant:
pool.init(&p, initial_msgs = 4, max_msgs = 0,
    hooks = MY_ITM_HOOKS)

// Complex type + custom allocator:
pool.init(&p, initial_msgs = 4, max_msgs = 0,
    hooks = MY_ITM_HOOKS, allocator = my_alloc)
```

**Rules**:
- All three fields are optional. nil = default behavior.
- `factory` must set `itm.allocator`. Must self-clean on failure. Returns `(nil, false)` on failure.
- `reset` must NOT free internal resources. Pool calls it outside the mutex.
- `dispose` must free internal resources, free the struct, set `itm^ = nil`.
- If you use `factory`, also use `dispose`. They are the create/destroy pair.
- The allocator is a separate `init` parameter, not a field in `T_Hooks`.

## Addendums

### Foundational Idioms

#### Lock release safety — `defer-unlock`
**Problem**: Lock acquired but function exits early → deadlock risk.
**Fix**: Register `defer unlock` immediately after lock acquisition.

```odin
sync.mutex_lock(&m)
defer sync.mutex_unlock(&m)
```

**Rule**: This is a foundational Odin pattern. In `odin-itc`, **never mark it with a tag** in the source code. It is documented here for reference only.

### Advice & Best Practices for New Idioms

1.  **Idiom 12 (`defer-destroy`)**:
    *   Always use this for `Pool`, `Mailbox`, and `Mbox` instances that are owned by the current scope.
    *   If the resource is part of a `Master` struct, the `Master_dispose` proc handles the destroy calls, and you use `defer Master_dispose(&m_opt)`.
2.  **Foundational `defer-unlock`**:
    *   In your own worker threads, if you use a custom mutex to protect shared state, use `defer unlock`.
    *   Never call a `mbox.send` or `pool.get` (blocking) while holding a custom lock if it could lead to an inversion or deadlock.
